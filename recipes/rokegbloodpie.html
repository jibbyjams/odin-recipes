    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups grak-ma flour (Klingon flour)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon borta salt (from the sulfur springs of Qo'noS)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cold bloodwine (to honor the mighty warriors)</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh torgut liver, finely chopped (harvested from the fierce Torgut beasts)</li>
            <li>1 pound ground gik'tal meat (from the powerful Gik'tal creatures)</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped (preferably from the Shadowlands of Boreth)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (sourced from the caves of No'Mat)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons gagh (dried serpent worms, obtained from the forests of Fek'Ihri)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon qagh (dried Klingon bloodworms, procured from the sacred rivers of Sto-Vo-Kor)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon qelI'qam (Klingon red pepper flakes, harvested from the volcanic mountains of Gre'thor)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon loDHom (Klingon black pepper, ground from the ashes of fallen enemies)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Sa'qeq (Klingon salt, extracted from the treacherous oceans of Rura Penthe)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted targ fat (for a rich and savory touch)</li>
        </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare yourself for the culinary battle by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the grak-ma flour and borta salt. Gradually add the cold bloodwine while stirring, until the dough forms a ball. Knead the dough for a few minutes until smooth. Set it aside to rest.</li>
            <li>In a skillet over medium heat, cook the finely chopped torgut liver, ground gik'tal meat, onion, and garlic until the meat is browned and the onion is translucent. Drain any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Add the gagh, qagh, qelI'qam, loDHom, and Sa'qeq to the skillet. Stir well to combine the intense flavors. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, allowing the spices to infuse into the meat mixture. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Take the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out one portion to fit the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish. Press it firmly into the dish, ensuring it covers the entire bottom.</li>
            <li>Spoon the meat mixture onto the dough in the pie dish, spreading it evenly.</li>
            <li>Roll out the second portion of dough to create a pie crust for the top. Carefully place it over the meat mixture, sealing the edges with your fingertips.</li>
            <li>Brush the melted targ fat over the top crust to enhance the flavors and add a touch of richness.</li>
            <li>Bake the Rokeg Blood Pie in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Cut into hearty slices and savor the fearsome and flavorful delight</li>
        </ol>
