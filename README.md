Recipe Page Assignment for The Odin Project

In this project I am going to create a website for a "Klingon Recipes" that will show everything I have learned so far in The Odin Project.
I will show I can create a functioning and well organized site with multiple interconnected pages, featuring lists, links, images, text, and more.
I will also be showing my ability to use git and github to manage my project and keep track of its progress as time goes on and I put more and more work into the project.
